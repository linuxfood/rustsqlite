These are sqlite bindings (version 3) for Rust.

To build, just run `rustc sqlite.rs`.

The interface is currently evolving both along with Rust and as I think of
better ways to implement various behaviors. If you have ideas about better
behavior for anything in this binding please feel free to open an issue.
